# Laravel 12.x Directory Structure

## Introduction

The default Laravel application structure is intended to provide a great starting point for both large and small applications. You are free to organize your application however you like. Laravel imposes almost no restrictions on where any given class is located — as long as Composer can autoload the class.

## The Root Directory

### The App Directory

The `app` directory contains the core code of your application. Almost all of the classes in your application will be in this directory.

### The Bootstrap Directory

The `bootstrap` directory contains the `app.php` file which bootstraps the framework. This directory also houses a `cache` directory which contains framework generated files for performance optimization such as the route and services cache files.

### The Config Directory

The `config` directory contains all of your application's configuration files. It's a great idea to read through all of these files and familiarize yourself with all of the options available to you.

### The Database Directory

The `database` directory contains:
- Your database migrations
- Model factories
- Seeds
- Optionally, an SQLite database

### The Public Directory

The `public` directory contains:
- The `index.php` file — the entry point for all requests entering your application and configures autoloading
- Your assets such as images, JavaScript, and CSS

### The Resources Directory

The `resources` directory contains:
- Your [views](../basics/views.md)
- Raw, un-compiled assets such as CSS or JavaScript

### The Routes Directory

The `routes` directory contains all of the route definitions for your application. By default, two route files are included with Laravel:

- **`web.php`** — Contains routes that Laravel places in the `web` middleware group, which provides session state, CSRF protection, and cookie encryption. If your application does not offer a stateless, RESTful API then all your routes will most likely be defined in this file.

- **`console.php`** — Where you may define all of your closure-based console commands. Each closure is bound to a command instance allowing a simple approach to interacting with each command's IO methods. Even though this file does not define HTTP routes, it defines console based entry points (routes) into your application. You may also [schedule](../digging-deeper/scheduling.md) tasks in this file.

Optionally, you may install additional route files via Artisan commands:
- **`api.php`** — Install via `install:api` command. Contains routes that are intended to be stateless and authenticated [via tokens](../packages/sanctum.md).
- **`channels.php`** — Install via `install:broadcasting` command. Where you may register all of the [event broadcasting](../digging-deeper/broadcasting.md) channels that your application supports.

### The Storage Directory

The `storage` directory contains:
- Logs
- Compiled Blade templates
- File based sessions
- File caches
- Other files generated by the framework

This directory is segregated into three subdirectories:
- **`app`** — May be used to store any files generated by your application
- **`framework`** — Used to store framework generated files and caches
- **`logs`** — Contains your application's log files

The `storage/app/public` directory may be used to store user-generated files, such as profile avatars, that should be publicly accessible. You should create a symbolic link at `public/storage` which points to this directory using:

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

### The Tests Directory

The `tests` directory contains your automated tests. Example [Pest](https://pestphp.com) or [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) unit tests and feature tests are provided out of the box. Each test class should be suffixed with the word `Test`.

You may run your tests using:
- `/vendor/bin/pest`
- `/vendor/bin/phpunit`
- `php artisan test` (for more detailed and beautiful results)

### The Vendor Directory

The `vendor` directory contains your [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) dependencies.

## The App Directory

The majority of your application is housed in the `app` directory. By default, this directory is namespaced under `App` and is autoloaded by Composer using the [PSR-4 autoloading standard](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/).

By default, the `app` directory contains the `Http`, `Models`, and `Providers` directories. However, over time, a variety of other directories will be generated inside the app directory as you use the make Artisan commands to generate classes.

Both the `Console` and `Http` directories provide an API into the core of your application:
- The **HTTP protocol** and **CLI** are mechanisms to interact with your application, but do not actually contain application logic
- The **`Console`** directory contains all of your Artisan commands
- The **`Http`** directory contains your controllers, middleware, and requests

To review the available commands, run:
```bash
php artisan list make
```

### The Broadcasting Directory

The `Broadcasting` directory contains all of the broadcast channel classes for your application. These classes are generated using the `make:channel` command. This directory does not exist by default, but will be created for you when you create your first channel. To learn more, check out the documentation on [event broadcasting](../digging-deeper/broadcasting.md).

### The Console Directory

The `Console` directory contains all of the custom Artisan commands for your application. These commands may be generated using the `make:command` command.

### The Events Directory

This directory does not exist by default, but will be created for you by the `event:generate` and `make:event` Artisan commands. The `Events` directory houses [event classes](../digging-deeper/events.md). Events may be used to alert other parts of your application that a given action has occurred, providing a great deal of flexibility and decoupling.

### The Exceptions Directory

The `Exceptions` directory contains all of the custom exceptions for your application. These exceptions may be generated using the `make:exception` command.

### The Http Directory

The `Http` directory contains:
- Controllers
- Middleware
- Form requests

Almost all of the logic to handle requests entering your application will be placed in this directory.

### The Jobs Directory

This directory does not exist by default, but will be created for you if you execute the `make:job` Artisan command. The `Jobs` directory houses the [queueable jobs](../digging-deeper/queues.md) for your application. Jobs may be queued by your application or run synchronously within the current request lifecycle. Jobs that run synchronously during the current request are sometimes referred to as "commands" since they are an implementation of the [command pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern).

### The Listeners Directory

This directory does not exist by default, but will be created for you if you execute the `event:generate` or `make:listener` Artisan commands. The `Listeners` directory contains the classes that handle your [events](../digging-deeper/events.md). Event listeners receive an event instance and perform logic in response to the event being fired. For example, a `UserRegistered` event might be handled by a `SendWelcomeEmail` listener.

### The Mail Directory

This directory does not exist by default, but will be created for you if you execute the `make:mail` Artisan command. The `Mail` directory contains all of your [classes that represent emails](../digging-deeper/mail.md) sent by your application. Mail objects allow you to encapsulate all of the logic of building an email in a single, simple class that may be sent using the `Mail::send` method.

### The Models Directory

The `Models` directory contains all of your [Eloquent model classes](../eloquent/eloquent.md). The Eloquent ORM included with Laravel provides a beautiful, simple ActiveRecord implementation for working with your database. Each database table has a corresponding "Model" which is used to interact with that table. Models allow you to query for data in your tables, as well as insert new records into the table.

### The Notifications Directory

This directory does not exist by default, but will be created for you if you execute the `make:notification` Artisan command. The `Notifications` directory contains all of the "transactional" [notifications](../digging-deeper/notifications.md) that are sent by your application, such as simple notifications about events that happen within your application. Laravel's notification feature abstracts sending notifications over a variety of drivers such as email, Slack, SMS, or stored in a database.

### The Policies Directory

This directory does not exist by default, but will be created for you if you execute the `make:policy` Artisan command. The `Policies` directory contains the [authorization policy classes](../security/authorization.md) for your application. Policies are used to determine if a user can perform a given action against a resource.

### The Providers Directory

The `Providers` directory contains all of the [service providers](../architecture/providers.md) for your application. Service providers bootstrap your application by binding services in the service container, registering events, or performing any other tasks to prepare your application for incoming requests.

In a fresh Laravel application, this directory will already contain the `AppServiceProvider`. You are free to add your own providers to this directory as needed.

### The Rules Directory

This directory does not exist by default, but will be created for you if you execute the `make:rule` Artisan command. The `Rules` directory contains the custom validation rule objects for your application. Rules are used to encapsulate complicated validation logic in a simple object. For more information, check out the [validation documentation](../basics/validation.md).
