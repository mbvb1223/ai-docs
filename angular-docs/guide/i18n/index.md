# Internationalization (i18n)
> Source: https://angular.dev/guide/i18n

## Overview

**Internationalization (i18n)** is the process of designing and preparing your project for use in different locales worldwide. **Localization** is building versions of your project for specific locales.

### Key Components of Localization

The localization process includes:

- Extracting text for translation into different languages
- Formatting data for a specific locale

### What is a Locale?

A locale identifies a region where people speak a particular language or language variant. Locales can represent countries or geographical regions and determine formatting and parsing of:

- Measurement units (date, time, numbers, currencies)
- Translated names (time zones, languages, countries)
