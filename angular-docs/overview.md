# What is Angular?
> Source: https://angular.dev/overview

Angular is a web framework maintained by Google that empowers developers to build fast, reliable applications that users love. The framework provides comprehensive tools, APIs, and libraries to streamline development workflows.

Angular offers developers a solid platform on which to build fast, reliable applications that scale with both the size of your team and the size of your codebase. Angular.dev serves as the official documentation hub.

## Key Features

### Components

Angular components facilitate code organization through well-encapsulated, modular parts. This architecture simplifies development and improves maintainability across projects of any size.

### Angular Signals

The framework implements a fine-grained reactivity model combined with compile-time optimizations, enabling developers to build faster applications by default with simplified development patterns.

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Angular supports both server-side rendering and static site generation, with complete DOM hydration capabilities for enhanced performance and SEO benefits.

### Dependency Injection

The built-in dependency injection system enables efficient code sharing across components throughout entire applications, improving modularity and testability.

### Angular Routing

A feature-rich navigation toolkit supporting route guards, data resolution, lazy-loading, and other advanced routing patterns.

### Forms Management

Angular provides standardized form participation and validation systems for consistent handling of user input across applications.

## Developer Tools

### Angular CLI

Command-line interface enabling project setup within minutes, with tools for development, testing, and production deployment.

### Angular DevTools

Browser extension providing component tree inspection, dependency injection visualization, and custom performance profiling.

### ng update

Automated code transformation tool that handles routine breaking changes during major version upgrades, streamlining the update process.

### Language Service

IDE integration powering code completion, navigation, refactoring, and real-time diagnostics across popular editors.

---

## Production & Reliability

### Testing Against Google's Monorepo

Every Angular commit undergoes verification against hundreds of thousands of tests in Google's internal code repository, ensuring stability for real-world scenarios at scale.

### Support & Release Schedule

Time-based release cycles and Long-Term Support (LTS) windows provide organizational confidence, with automated migration schematics supporting version upgrades.

---

## Scalability & Security

### Internationalization

Built-in i18n support handles message translations and formatting using Unicode ICU syntax standards.

### Security Features

Angular prioritizes development safe by default with HTML sanitization and trusted type support mitigating cross-site vulnerabilities.

### Build Performance

Modern build pipeline using Vite and ESBuild enables rapid compilation even for projects with hundreds of thousands of lines of code.

### Proven Scale

Production usage across major Google products including Google Fonts and Google Cloud demonstrates real-world scalability.

---

## Community & Ecosystem

### Open Source Development

All code, commits, and pull requests are publicly available on GitHub with active issue triage and community engagement.

### Public Roadmap

Transparent development direction with Request for Comments (RFCs) soliciting community feedback on major features.

### Community Resources

Extensive ecosystem including courses, blogs, open-source contributions, and partnerships with Google Developer Experts (GDEs).

### Technology Partnerships

Collaborative relationships with Chrome Aurora, Firebase, TensorFlow, Flutter, Material Design, and Google Cloud enhance integration across the developer workflow.
