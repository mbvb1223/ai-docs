# Claude Code GitHub Actions

> Learn about integrating Claude Code into your development workflow with Claude Code GitHub Actions

Claude Code GitHub Actions brings AI-powered automation to your GitHub workflow. With a simple `@claude` mention in any PR or issue, Claude can analyze your code, create pull requests, implement features, and fix bugs - all while following your project's standards.

> **Note:** Claude Code GitHub Actions is built on top of the [Claude Agent SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview), which enables programmatic integration of Claude Code into your applications. You can use the SDK to build custom automation workflows beyond GitHub Actions.

> **Info:** Claude Opus 4.6 is now available. Claude Code GitHub Actions default to Sonnet. To use Opus 4.6, configure the [model parameter](#breaking-changes-reference) to use `claude-opus-4-6`.

## Why use Claude Code GitHub Actions?

* **Instant PR creation**: Describe what you need, and Claude creates a complete PR with all necessary changes
* **Automated code implementation**: Turn issues into working code with a single command
* **Follows your standards**: Claude respects your `CLAUDE.md` guidelines and existing code patterns
* **Simple setup**: Get started in minutes with our installer and API key
* **Secure by default**: Your code stays on Github's runners

## Setup

## Quick setup

The easiest way to set up this action is through Claude Code in the terminal. Just open claude and run `/install-github-app`.

This command will guide you through setting up the GitHub app and required secrets.

> **Note:**
> * You must be a repository admin to install the GitHub app and add secrets
> * The GitHub app will request read & write permissions for Contents, Issues, and Pull requests
> * This quickstart method is only available for direct Claude API users. If you're using AWS Bedrock or Google Vertex AI, please see the [Using with AWS Bedrock & Google Vertex AI](#using-with-aws-bedrock--google-vertex-ai) section.

## Manual setup

If the `/install-github-app` command fails or you prefer manual setup, please follow these manual setup instructions:

1. **Install the Claude GitHub app** to your repository: [https://github.com/apps/claude](https://github.com/apps/claude)

   The Claude GitHub app requires the following repository permissions:

   * **Contents**: Read & write (to modify repository files)
   * **Issues**: Read & write (to respond to issues)
   * **Pull requests**: Read & write (to create PRs and push changes)

   For more details on security and permissions, see the [security documentation](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/docs/security.md).

2. **Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY** to your repository secrets ([Learn how to use secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions))

3. **Copy the workflow file** from [examples/claude.yml](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/examples/claude.yml) into your repository's `.github/workflows/`

> **Tip:** After completing either the quickstart or manual setup, test the action by tagging `@claude` in an issue or PR comment.

## Example use cases

Claude Code GitHub Actions can help you with a variety of tasks. The [examples directory](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/tree/main/examples) contains ready-to-use workflows for different scenarios.

### Basic workflow

```yaml
name: Claude Code
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]
jobs:
  claude:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
        with:
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          # Responds to @claude mentions in comments
```

### Using skills

```yaml
name: Code Review
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
        with:
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          prompt: "/review"
          claude_args: "--max-turns 5"
```

### Custom automation with prompts

```yaml
name: Daily Report
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 9 * * *"
jobs:
  report:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
        with:
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          prompt: "Generate a summary of yesterday's commits and open issues"
          claude_args: "--model opus"
```

### Common use cases

In issue or PR comments:

```
@claude implement this feature based on the issue description
@claude how should I implement user authentication for this endpoint?
@claude fix the TypeError in the user dashboard component
```

Claude will automatically analyze the context and respond appropriately.

## Best practices

### CLAUDE.md configuration

Create a `CLAUDE.md` file in your repository root to define code style guidelines, review criteria, project-specific rules, and preferred patterns. This file guides Claude's understanding of your project standards.

### Security considerations

> **Warning:** Never commit API keys directly to your repository.

For comprehensive security guidance including permissions, authentication, and best practices, see the [Claude Code Action security documentation](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/docs/security.md).

Always use GitHub Secrets for API keys:

* Add your API key as a repository secret named `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
* Reference it in workflows: `anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}`
* Limit action permissions to only what's necessary
* Review Claude's suggestions before merging

Always use GitHub Secrets (for example, `${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}`) rather than hardcoding API keys directly in your workflow files.

### Optimizing performance

Use issue templates to provide context, keep your `CLAUDE.md` concise and focused, and configure appropriate timeouts for your workflows.

### CI costs

When using Claude Code GitHub Actions, be aware of the associated costs:

**GitHub Actions costs:**

* Claude Code runs on GitHub-hosted runners, which consume your GitHub Actions minutes
* See [GitHub's billing documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions) for detailed pricing and minute limits

**API costs:**

* Each Claude interaction consumes API tokens based on the length of prompts and responses
* Token usage varies by task complexity and codebase size
* See [Claude's pricing page](https://claude.com/platform/api) for current token rates

**Cost optimization tips:**

* Use specific `@claude` commands to reduce unnecessary API calls
* Configure appropriate `--max-turns` in `claude_args` to prevent excessive iterations
* Set workflow-level timeouts to avoid runaway jobs
* Consider using GitHub's concurrency controls to limit parallel runs

## Configuration examples

The Claude Code Action v1 simplifies configuration with unified parameters:

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    prompt: "Your instructions here" # Optional
    claude_args: "--max-turns 5" # Optional CLI arguments
```

Key features:

* **Unified prompt interface** - Use `prompt` for all instructions
* **Commands** - Prebuilt prompts like `/review` or `/fix`
* **CLI passthrough** - Any Claude Code CLI argument via `claude_args`
* **Flexible triggers** - Works with any GitHub event

Visit the [examples directory](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/tree/main/examples) for complete workflow files.

> **Tip:** When responding to issue or PR comments, Claude automatically responds to @claude mentions. For other events, use the `prompt` parameter to provide instructions.

## Using with AWS Bedrock & Google Vertex AI

For enterprise environments, you can use Claude Code GitHub Actions with your own cloud infrastructure. This approach gives you control over data residency and billing while maintaining the same functionality.

### Prerequisites

Before setting up Claude Code GitHub Actions with cloud providers, you need:

#### For Google Cloud Vertex AI:

1. A Google Cloud Project with Vertex AI enabled
2. Workload Identity Federation configured for GitHub Actions
3. A service account with the required permissions
4. A GitHub App (recommended) or use the default GITHUB_TOKEN

#### For AWS Bedrock:

1. An AWS account with Amazon Bedrock enabled
2. GitHub OIDC Identity Provider configured in AWS
3. An IAM role with Bedrock permissions
4. A GitHub App (recommended) or use the default GITHUB_TOKEN

## Troubleshooting

### Claude not responding to @claude commands

Verify the GitHub App is installed correctly, check that workflows are enabled, ensure API key is set in repository secrets, and confirm the comment contains `@claude` (not `/claude`).

### CI not running on Claude's commits

Ensure you're using the GitHub App or custom app (not Actions user), check workflow triggers include the necessary events, and verify app permissions include CI triggers.

### Authentication errors

Confirm API key is valid and has sufficient permissions. For Bedrock/Vertex, check credentials configuration and ensure secrets are named correctly in workflows.

## Advanced configuration

### Action parameters

The Claude Code Action v1 uses a simplified configuration:

| Parameter           | Description                                            | Required |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| `prompt`            | Instructions for Claude (text or skill like `/review`) | No*      |
| `claude_args`       | CLI arguments passed to Claude Code                    | No       |
| `anthropic_api_key` | Claude API key                                         | Yes**    |
| `github_token`      | GitHub token for API access                            | No       |
| `trigger_phrase`    | Custom trigger phrase (default: "@claude")             | No       |
| `use_bedrock`       | Use AWS Bedrock instead of Claude API                  | No       |
| `use_vertex`        | Use Google Vertex AI instead of Claude API             | No       |

*Prompt is optional - when omitted for issue/PR comments, Claude responds to trigger phrase
**Required for direct Claude API, not for Bedrock/Vertex

#### Pass CLI arguments

The `claude_args` parameter accepts any Claude Code CLI arguments:

```yaml
claude_args: "--max-turns 5 --model claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 --mcp-config /path/to/config.json"
```

Common arguments:

* `--max-turns`: Maximum conversation turns (default: 10)
* `--model`: Model to use (for example, `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`)
* `--mcp-config`: Path to MCP configuration
* `--allowed-tools`: Comma-separated list of allowed tools
* `--debug`: Enable debug output

### Alternative integration methods

While the `/install-github-app` command is the recommended approach, you can also:

* **Custom GitHub App**: For organizations needing branded usernames or custom authentication flows. Create your own GitHub App with required permissions (contents, issues, pull requests) and use the actions/create-github-app-token action to generate tokens in your workflows.
* **Manual GitHub Actions**: Direct workflow configuration for maximum flexibility
* **MCP Configuration**: Dynamic loading of Model Context Protocol servers

See the [Claude Code Action documentation](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/docs) for detailed guides on authentication, security, and advanced configuration.

### Customizing Claude's behavior

You can configure Claude's behavior in two ways:

1. **CLAUDE.md**: Define coding standards, review criteria, and project-specific rules in a `CLAUDE.md` file at the root of your repository. Claude will follow these guidelines when creating PRs and responding to requests. Check out our [Memory documentation](/en/memory) for more details.
2. **Custom prompts**: Use the `prompt` parameter in the workflow file to provide workflow-specific instructions. This allows you to customize Claude's behavior for different workflows or tasks.

Claude will follow these guidelines when creating PRs and responding to requests.
