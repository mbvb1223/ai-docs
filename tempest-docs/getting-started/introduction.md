# Introduction

Tempest is a PHP development framework designed to minimize friction and maximize productivity. It represents "the sweet spot between the robustness of Symfony and the eloquence of Laravel."

## Core Philosophy

The framework is built on four foundational principles:

### 1. Community-Driven

Started as an educational project, Tempest now has three core maintainers and 50+ contributors, with an active Discord community of ~400 members.

### 2. Modern PHP Embracement

The framework leverages contemporary PHP features including property hooks, attributes, and proxy objects from inception.

### 3. Non-Intrusive Design

Rather than imposing structural requirements, Tempest supports MVC, DDD, hexagonal architecture, and microservices patterns equally well through its "discovery" mechanism.

### 4. Innovative Approaches

Features like console commands modeled after controller actions and decoupled ORM models challenge conventional framework patterns.

## Key Features

- **Discovery system**: Automatically recognizes routing, commands, components, listeners, and migrations without explicit configuration
- **Extensibility**: Framework components can be replaced via container injection
- **View engine**: Uses HTML as its template language with custom directives
